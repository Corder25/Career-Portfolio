# Career-Portfolio
In this career portfolio I attempted to use the grid system to place each item as close as possible to the given example. In the nav bar i linked all the pages together so they would transition to each page smoothly. i was told we would be returning to this project to make it "prettier" so i didnt really bother for esthetics. we were asked to make the page responsive as well and i tried using sizing and margining that would do so.
